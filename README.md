The following **required** functionality is complete:
## User Stories
* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

* [] This app can split an account for several people and show the amount of money each one has to pay.

## Notes
Using objc has helped me to understand that it is very important to check memory and be aware of pointers.
